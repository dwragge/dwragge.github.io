# Who Am I?  

I am currently attending the University of Auckland, pursuing a conjoint BA/BSc degree majoring in French and Computer Science, as well as taking a number of Mathematics papers. In order to pay the bills and travel the world, I also work part-time as a salesperson at Noel Leeming (if you need a new washing machine, let me know!)

Having taken a keen interest in computers from the age of 7 and after saving dilligently, I began my programming career by purchasing (book title). A few years later, I moved onto C++ and purchased [Sam's Teach Yourself C++ in 1 hour a Day](https://www.amazon.com/Sams-Teach-Yourself-One-Hour/dp/0672335670). Soon after, a friend and I started making little games using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/). This continued on and off for a few years before I picked up C#, which I took and instant liking to. Over the years, I have continued to refine and hone my skills, discovering new ways to write cleaner and more concise code. With this, however, came my fixation on clean code, where I will spend hours refactoring code to make it just that little bit cleaner.

After incorporating [Dymajo](https://www.dymajo.com) with a few friends in 2015, we have been working on creating a beautiful FTP client, but with university and travels interrupting development, and my idea to rewrite the entire backend in .NET Core, it is taking some time. For several months, during the Summer of 2016-2017, I was an intern at [Sandfield](https://www.sandfield.co.nz/Home), creating a customer-facing portal to manage EDI Transactions. In the future, I would love to work with some languages such as [Go](https://www.golang.org) and especially [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), which looks very promising.

Outside of programming and uni, I enjoy things such as photography and travelling - discovering new places both in New Zealand and abroad. I have a keen interest in all things commercial aviation and who knows, one day I might change career entirely and become a pilot. I'm also a bit of a coffee aficionado and drink far too much of it, but then again, who doesn't?
